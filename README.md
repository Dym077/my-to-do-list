## Deployment
* This project was deployed using Heroku.
I made an early deployment to ensure that the live app was running correctly and that the versions of the libraries were working together.
- This is how to create the Heroku app:
- Log in to Heroku or create a new account.
- When on the main page, click the button called New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Type in the name of the app, which must be unique to work.
- Select your region.
- Click the Create App button.
- Click the Settings Tab - scroll down to Config Vars.
- Click Reveal Config Vars and enter PORT into the Key box and 8000 into the Value box and click the Add button.
