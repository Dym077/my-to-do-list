## Why a To-do-list app?

### 

### 
### 
## Site Owner Goals
## User Stories

### First time user

### Returning user

### Frequent user

## Features
### Authentication
* A new user will be prompted to create a user name and a password. As soon as that is done, the user will be able to log on to the site and start using the features. A returning user will already have created a user name and can log in with those credentials. The user will also be able to change the password if necessary.

## Features

### CRUD Implementation
- This app makes use of the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update & Delete).
For example, when a user is adding a new goal or task, the app is creating this item.
The user is then able to view this item, which is making use of the "read"-operation
If a user has to update a goal or task, the selected item can be edited in the form and submitted again,
which makes use of the "update"-operation. Finally, if a user wants to delete a goal or task, clicking the Delete- button 
will make use of the "delete"-operation and the item will be erased accordingly.

## Deployment
* This project was deployed using Heroku.
I made an early deployment to ensure that the live app was running correctly and that the versions of the libraries were working together.
- This is how to create the Heroku app:
- Log in to Heroku or create a new account.
- When on the main page, click the button called New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Type in the name of the app, which must be unique to work.
- Select your region.
- Click the Create App button.
- Click the Settings Tab - scroll down to Config Vars.
- Click Reveal Config Vars and enter PORT into the Key box and 8000 into the Value box and click the Add button.
